        <p>Hello, my name is Melody Chan-Yoeun and welcome to my "all about me" page! Some of the most basic info about me: I am 21 (but I turn 22 this week), I am from Sacramento, CA, and I am a 4th year at UCI. Learning how to make websites has been pretty daunting, but I hope to get the hang of it soon! I chose this image to represent me because my favorite Sanrio character is My Melody (the character pictured) and I also often feel like I am floating by in a sea of many responsibilities.</p>
